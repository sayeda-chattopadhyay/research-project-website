        "As part of a Noroff assignment, I created la-Boutique, an intuitive, functional, and responsive eCommerce website using React. Users can effortlessly add items to their cart and enjoy flexibility with options to add or remove selected products. The site is styled with Bootstrap and styled components, ensuring a seamless user experience. To enhance data validation, I incorporated a validated contact form utilizing Yup and react-hook-form. This project marked my initiation into React application development, and its implementation presented a valuable learning experience.",

        "Holidaze, my final project for Noroff's front-end development course, introduces a new front-end application for an accommodation booking site. It features a user-friendly interface for booking holidays and an admin panel for venue registration and booking management. The project embraces modern front-end workflows, utilizing Gantt charts, Kanban boards, and mid-fidelity prototypes in Figma. Crafted with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, the website boasts a seamless user experience. Formik handles state management and form validation, while the integration of React Date Picker adds a sophisticated calendar feature. This comprehensive endeavor reflects not just technical proficiency but also a genuine enjoyment of the creative process, marking a milestone in my front-end development journey.",

      description:
        "For my inaugural year-end exam project, I developed an auction website that allows users to both list items for bidding and bid on items posted by fellow users. The platform offers a starting balance of 1000 credits to new users, which can be utilized for both selling and purchasing items within the auction environment. While non-registered users can peruse the listings, only those registered have the privilege of placing bids. ",
